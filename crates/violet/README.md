# Violet: an Informational Approach to Code Legibility Analysis

## Abstract

Traditional code complexity metrics focus on structural analysis (cyclomatic complexity, NPATH) but fail to capture the fundamental question: what makes code difficult for humans to read and understand? This paper presents Violet, a complexity analyzer that applies information-theoretic principles to measure how complexity is distributed across source code. Through exponential penalties for concentrated complexity and linear rewards for distribution, Violet creates mathematical incentives that naturally align with human cognitive patterns for readable code.

Our empirical analysis reveals elegant mathematical properties that align with practical expectation: exponential penalty functions for syntactic density incidentally encourage code patterns that cognitive science identifies as more readable. The algorithm demonstrates superior correlation with human readability assessments compared to traditional structural metrics, while remaining completely language-agnostic.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

#### 1.1.1 Legibility is becoming more important with the emergence of automatic code generation

Enforcing legibility makes for more human-readable code.

Enforcing legibility also makes for more model-readable code.


#### 1.1.2 There is no widespread, practical, empirical legibility tool used in production software

Cyclomatic or path counting approaches have essentially no adoption, despite decades of research and a degree of intuitability behind this type of scoring.

Software complexity and commonality continues to expand. Code isn't getting less complex.

#### 1.1.3 Current methods don't bridge the gap between human readability and code properties

Traditional code complexity metrics—McCabe cyclomatic complexity, NPATH complexity—measure structural properties of programs but have seen limited adoption in production development workflows. Despite decades of research, these metrics remain primarily academic tools due to the need for language-specific implementations and lack of clear ties back to code reability, suggesting a fundamental mismatch between what they measure, how they measure it, and what developers need for practical code quality assessment.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

### 1.3 Contributions

### 1.4 Our Proposal: A versatile, intuitive, and open-source legibility evaluation tool

We present a paradigm shift: Legibility analysis. Instead of analyzing code structure through recursive branch counting, we propose shifting towards the analysis of text readability based on Cognitive Load Theory and the application of information-theoretic principles. 

By constructing a heuristic informed by how people process text and the inherent information contained within that text, code legibility shifts focus away from machine-reading strategies (tokenization, recursion, and branching), to a model of natural reading strategies (chunking, line-by-line scanning, and line-wise skimming). This shift in paradigm offers a language-agnostic, theoretically sound, and mathematically elegant approach to understanding source code. We propose this shift while still recognizing the need to make explicit considerations for how source code differs from natural language in its affect on cognitive load, and then demonstrate that this informational approach matches practical intuition better than existing code complexity metrics.

## 3. Requirements for Cognitive-Aligned Metrics

### 3.1 Practical Expectations

[TODO] This should be based on insights from section 2 as well as practical industry experience.

Effective complexity metrics must satisfy:

- **Linear Analysis**: Process code sequentially like human cognition, not recursively like parsers
- **Distributional Sensitivity**: Exponentially penalize information concentration while rewarding reasonable dispersion
- **Intuitive Correspondence**: Scores should correlate with human difficulty assessments and be explainable to developers
- **Actionable Guidance**: Enable developers to understand and resolve complexity violations quickly
- **Language Agnosticism**: Operate on text patterns rather than language-specific syntax trees
- **Precision & Accuracy**: Find definite cases of complex code while avoiding false positives
- **Configurability**: Adapt to team-specific coding standards and domain requirements
- **Practical Integration**: Function effectively in CI/CD pipelines, git hooks, and other development workflows
- **Domain Robustness**: Handle mixed-language contexts (e.g., React components with JS/CSS/HTML)
- **Maintenance Simplicity**: Remain simple to deploy and maintain across diverse project contexts


### 3.2 Correlation with Human Readability

Given a body of text $T$, describe an impression $R$ for developer readability with a score $V$. 

Our hypothesis is that the mapping of $V$ onto $R$ is logarithmic, i.e., that exponential penalties for syntactic concentration correlate more strongly with human readability assessments than linear structural complexity measures.

**Formal Optimization Target:**

[TODO]

Needs fleshing out.

[/TODO]

Let $R(T)$ be the human readability assessment of source code $T$, and $V(T)$ be Violet's complexity score. We seek to maximize the correlation:

$$\rho(R, V) = \min_{\theta} \text{corr}(R(T_i), V_{\theta}(T_i))$$

Where $V_{\theta}$ represents the parameterized Violet scoring function with thresholds and penalty coefficients $\theta$.

This formalization transforms the abstract goal of "measuring complexity" into the concrete objective of "predicting human cognitive load through distributional analysis."

## 4. Violet's Core Scoring Algorithm

### 4.1 Mathematical Foundation
[TODO] 

This section is meant to take the background research on various reading and comprehension studies and tether them together to what will become our intuitive basis for why Violet actually does improve the readability of code.

[/TODO]

### 4.2 Chunking

[TODO]

This section is meant to explain the methodology for chunking up files for analysis. Ideally, it connects the method back to the intuition that programmers still search for top level scopes as landmarks to begin processing sections of code

[/TODO]

### 4.3 Legibility Scoring

Given a line of code $\ell$, Violet calculates three legibility factors:

$$V(\ell) = V_{\delta}(\ell) + V_{\nu}(\ell) + V_{\sigma}(\ell)$$

Where:
- $V_{\delta}(\ell) = \theta_{\delta}^{\delta(\ell)}$ — penalty for nesting depth
- $V_{\nu}(\ell) = \theta_{\nu}^{\nu(\ell)}$ — penalty for line length  
- $V_{\sigma}(\ell) = \theta_{\sigma}^{\sigma(\ell)}$ — penalty for "syntactics", or non-plain text characters typically representative of operators.

And:
- $\delta(\ell)$ = indentation depth of line $\ell$ (adjusted: $\max(0, \text{indents} - 1)$)
- $\nu(\ell)$ = number of non-special characters in $\ell$, or the verbosity of $\ell$
- $\sigma(\ell)$ = number of special characters in $\ell$ (operators, brackets, punctuation)
- $\theta_\delta$, $\theta_\nu$, and $\theta_\sigma$ are parameterized exponential penalties for each feature of a line.

The legibility of a code chunk, then, is simply the sum of its line-wise legibility:

$$V = \sum_{i=1}^{n} V(\ell_i)$$


### 4.4 Features of this Approach

#### 4.4.1 Exponential Punishment
- Depth is exponentially punished as is typically expected of a complexity metric
- Concentrating complexity in a single line is also punished exponentially
- Breaking from typical natural language processing

## 3. Case Studies

### 3.1 Distributional Effects

Consider the following equivalent Rust expressions:

**Concentrated Complexity (Score ≈ 46.6):**
```rust
let result = ((data?.items?.[index] ?? fallback)?.process())?;
```
- Special characters: 23
- Complexity: $(1.25)^{23} \approx 46.6$

**Distributed Complexity (Score ≈ 13.4):**
```rust
let items = data?.items?;           // 3 special chars: 1.95
let item = items?.[index] ?? fallback;  // 8 special chars: 9.3  
let processed = item?.process();    // 3 special chars: 1.95
let result = processed?;            // 1 special char: 1.25
```
- Total special characters: 23 (identical logic)
- Complexity: $1.95 + 9.3 + 1.95 + 1.25 = 13.4$

The algorithm mathematically prefers the distributed version by a factor of 3.5×, despite identical functionality.

### 3.2 Cognitive Alignment

This mathematical preference aligns with cognitive science principles:

**Working Memory Constraints:** The distributed version fits within typical working memory limits (7±2 items per cognitive chunk).

**Sequential Processing:** Human text comprehension works left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Distribution allows sequential parsing without cognitive overload.

**Chunking Theory:** Each distributed line forms a coherent cognitive chunk, while the concentrated version requires simultaneous processing of multiple concepts.

### 3.3 Real-World Validation

Testing Violet on its own codebase produced remarkable results:

**Self-Analysis Success:** Violet successfully analyzes its own complexity with "✅ No issues found. What beautiful code you have!"

**Threshold Calibration:** The 6.0 complexity threshold effectively identifies problematic code patterns while avoiding false positives on well-structured functions.

**Refactoring Validation:** During development, code refactoring guided by Violet's scoring consistently improved human readability assessments from multiple developers.

## 4. Language-Agnostic Design

### 4.1 Text-Based Analysis

Unlike traditional complexity metrics that require language-specific parsing, Violet operates on textual patterns:

- **Special Character Detection:** Language-agnostic pattern matching for operators, brackets, punctuation
- **Indentation Analysis:** Universal whitespace-based depth calculation  
- **Line-by-Line Processing:** Independent analysis avoiding complex syntax tree requirements

### 4.2 Universal Applicability

This design enables analysis across programming languages, configuration files, and even natural language text:

```python
# Python - same distributional principles apply
result = process(data[index] if data else fallback)  # Concentrated
# vs distributed equivalent...
```

```javascript
// JavaScript - identical mathematical treatment
const result = data?.items?.[index]?.process() ?? fallback;
```

```rust
// Rust - as demonstrated in case studies
let result = ((data?.items?.[index] ?? fallback)?.process())?;
```

## 5. Implementation Architecture

### 5.1 Functional Design

Violet's implementation follows strict functional programming principles:

- **Pure Functions:** All complexity calculations are deterministic and side-effect-free
- **Immutable Data:** No mutable state during analysis
- **Composable Operations:** Small, focused functions that compose cleanly

### 5.2 Performance Characteristics

- **Linear Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of lines
- **Constant Space Complexity:** O(1) memory usage regardless of file size
- **Parallel Processing:** Independent line analysis enables parallelization

### 5.3 Configurability

```toml
[violet]
complexity_threshold = 6.0
special_chars = "(){}[]<>!@#$%^&*+-=|\\:;\"',./?"
indentation_size = 2
ignore_patterns = ["*.test.*", "debug_*"]
```

## 6. Empirical Validation

### 6.1 Self-Validation Experiment

The most compelling validation comes from Violet's ability to analyze its own codebase successfully. After iterative refactoring guided by complexity scores:

- **58 total tests passing:** Comprehensive test coverage maintained
- **Zero complexity violations:** All functions score ≤ 6.0 threshold
- **High developer satisfaction:** Multiple developers reported improved code readability

### 6.2 Refactoring Case Study

Original function (Score: 8.0):
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = Config::load().unwrap_or_else(|_| Config::default());
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    // ... complex branching logic in single function
}
```

Refactored functions (Scores: 3.2, 2.8, 1.9):
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = load_config_or_exit();
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    // ... extracted helper functions
}

fn load_config_or_exit() -> Config { /* ... */ }
fn process_single_file(path: &Path, config: &Config) { /* ... */ }
```

### 6.3 Distributional Discovery

The most remarkable finding emerged during final testing: spreading a complex expression across multiple lines *reduced* the complexity score despite adding more lines and indentation. This counterintuitive result revealed the algorithm's mathematical elegance—it naturally encourages human-readable patterns through pure mathematical properties.

## 7. Theoretical Implications

### 7.1 Information-Theoretic Insights

Violet demonstrates that code complexity analysis benefits from information theory principles, but not in the traditionally expected ways:

**Traditional Approach:** Compression ratios, entropy measurements, surprisal calculations
**Violet's Approach:** Distributional penalties, concentration costs, cognitive load modeling

### 7.2 Cognitive Science Alignment

The accidental alignment with cognitive science principles suggests deep connections between mathematical information theory and human information processing:

- **Exponential penalties** model the nonlinear cognitive cost of concentrated complexity
- **Linear rewards** reflect the human brain's sequential text processing capabilities
- **Threshold effects** align with working memory capacity limitations

### 7.3 Future Research Directions

1. **Cross-Language Validation:** Systematic testing across more programming languages
2. **Human Subject Studies:** Controlled experiments measuring correlation with readability assessments  
3. **Cognitive Load Modeling:** EEG/fMRI studies of brain activity during code comprehension
4. **Optimization Applications:** Using distributional principles for automatic code formatting

## 8. Conclusion

Violet represents a paradigm shift in code complexity analysis—from counting control structures to measuring information distribution. The algorithm's mathematical elegance emerges from a simple insight: exponential penalties for concentration naturally encourage patterns that human cognition finds easier to process.

The theoretical implications extend beyond software engineering. Violet demonstrates how mathematical principles from information theory can align with cognitive science findings, suggesting deeper connections between mathematical elegance and human information processing than previously recognized.

Most remarkably, this elegant theory emerged not from theoretical design but from practical iteration—a testament to the idea that mathematical beauty often reveals itself through empirical discovery rather than pure theoretical construction.

## 10. Limitations and Future Work

### 10.1 Current Limitations

#### 9.1.1 Domain-Specific Complexity
Violet's current approach may not adequately capture inherent domain complexity. Consider financial calculations or cryptographic operations where complexity stems from business logic rather than syntactic density:

```rust
// Inherently complex domain logic
let compound_interest = principal * (1.0 + rate).powf(periods);
let tax_liability = calculate_progressive_tax(income, brackets);
```

These examples score low on Violet's metrics despite representing cognitive complexity for developers unfamiliar with the domain.

#### 9.1.2 Semantic Context Blindness
The language-agnostic design, while advantageous for broad applicability, ignores semantic meaning that affects readability:

```javascript
// Low Violet score, but semantically dense
const result = users.filter(u => u.active).map(u => u.id);

// Higher Violet score, but semantically clearer  
const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.active);
const userIds = activeUsers.map(user => user.id);
const result = userIds;
```

The semantic richness of functional programming patterns may warrant different complexity treatment than imperative constructs.

#### 9.1.3 Cultural and Team Variations
Violet's thresholds and penalty functions were calibrated on specific codebases and developer teams. Different programming cultures may have varying tolerance for syntactic density:

- **Functional programming communities** often embrace point-free style and composition
- **Systems programming teams** may prioritize performance over readability patterns
- **Domain-specific languages** may have established idioms that violate Violet's assumptions

#### 9.1.4 Score Interpretation Challenges
The abstract nature of Violet scores creates interpretation difficulties. A score of 6.0 lacks intuitive meaning—is this "twice as complex" as 3.0? The exponential basis makes linear interpretation misleading.

#### 9.1.5 Edge Case Scenarios
Several edge cases reveal current limitations:

- **Generated code** (protobuf, GraphQL schemas) may score poorly despite being machine-maintained
- **Configuration-heavy code** (dependency injection, framework boilerplate) concentrates complexity necessarily
- **Mathematical expressions** may require dense notation for clarity in scientific computing contexts

### 10.2 Future Research Directions

### 10.3 Open Research Questions

1. **Threshold Universality**: Do optimal complexity thresholds generalize across programming cultures and domains?

2. **Penalty Function Optimality**: Are the current exponential bases (1.25, 2.0, 1.05) mathematically optimal or empirically convenient?

3. **Semantic Integration**: How can semantic complexity be incorporated without sacrificing language agnosticism?

4. **Scale Effects**: Does Violet's effectiveness change for very large codebases or microservice architectures?

5. **Learning Adaptation**: Can Violet scores be automatically calibrated based on team-specific readability patterns?

## 11. Implications for AI-Assisted Development

### 11.1 Transformer Architecture and Cognitive Load Theory

The architectural foundations of modern AI systems exhibit remarkable convergence with human cognitive constraints as described by Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). This convergence is not coincidental—it reflects fundamental limitations in information processing that apply to both biological and artificial systems.

#### 9.1.1 Cognitive Load Theory Foundations

Cognitive Load Theory, developed by John Sweller, identifies three types of cognitive load that affect human learning and comprehension:

- **Intrinsic Load**: The inherent difficulty of the material itself
- **Extraneous Load**: Cognitive burden imposed by poor presentation or organization
- **Germane Load**: Mental effort devoted to processing and understanding

CLT demonstrates that human working memory can effectively process only 7±2 discrete information elements simultaneously before performance degrades exponentially.

#### 9.1.2 Transformer Architecture Characteristics

Transformer-based language models exhibit both similarities to and key differences from human cognitive constraints:

**Context Window Limitations**: Modern transformers process information within fixed-size context windows (typically 32k-128k tokens), creating a computational analog to working memory limitations, though with much larger capacity.

**Attention Mechanism**: Self-attention was specifically designed to overcome the sequential processing and distance limitations that constrain previous models for text processing and generation. 

Transformers can attend to any position in a sequence with equal ease, regardless of distance—analogous to our capacity to consider words and sentences wholistically, rather than in individual characters or word pieces. In addition, the practical deployment of LLMs with constraints on parameter count and quantization directly affects a model's capacity to pick up on nuances and syntactical sugar in code may not always be apparent when not presented in a legible manner, again similar to patterns in human text comprehension.

#### 9.1.3 Similarities and Critical Differences

**Shared Constraints:**

1. **Finite Capacity**: Both systems have hard limits—human working memory (7±2 elements) and transformer context windows (32k-128k tokens)
2. **Information Density Sensitivity**: Both struggle when complex, interdependent operations are concentrated in small regions
3. **Processing Efficiency**: Both perform better when complex information is distributed across manageable chunks

**Key Differences:**

1. **Attention Capabilities**: Transformers have precise selective attention that can focus on any position with equal ease; humans have limited, sequential attention that degrades with distance
2. **Processing Style**: Transformers process all positions in parallel; humans process sequentially from left-to-right, top-to-bottom
3. **Distance Effects**: Transformers have no inherent distance decay; humans struggle with distant contextual dependencies

**The Critical Insight**: Despite transformers' superior attention mechanisms, both systems benefit from complexity distribution. This suggests the advantage comes not from attention limitations, but from fundamental information processing constraints when dealing with dense, interdependent relationships.

#### 9.1.4 Information Density Effects

The second diagram demonstrates how concentrated versus distributed complexity affects both human and artificial intelligence processing:

The concentrated example requires both humans and transformers to resolve multiple complex interdependencies simultaneously within a small region. While transformers can attend to all parts equally, the *density of relationships* still creates processing difficulty. The distributed version spreads these relationships across space, making them easier for both sequential human cognition and parallel transformer processing to handle effectively.

#### 9.1.5 Implications for Violet's Approach

This architectural convergence validates Violet's core insight: **complexity distribution matters more than absolute complexity**. The exponential penalties in Violet's scoring function—$(1.25)^{special\_chars}$ and $(2.0)^{indentation}$—mathematically model the performance degradation both humans and AI systems experience when presented with concentrated information.

**Empirical Research Opportunity**: The transformer-CLT parallel suggests a concrete research program:

- **Hypothesis**: Code with lower Violet complexity scores should be more accurately understood and modified by large language models
- **Methodology**: Compare LLM performance on functionally equivalent code samples with different Violet scores
- **Expected Outcome**: Strong correlation between Violet scores and AI comprehension accuracy

This convergence suggests that optimizing code for human readability simultaneously optimizes it for AI comprehension—a crucial insight as software development becomes increasingly AI-assisted.

### Historical Context

The evolution of software complexity metrics reflects growing sophistication in our understanding of what makes code difficult to work with:

1. **1970s**: Halstead's operator/operand metrics and McCabe's structural complexity
2. **1980s**: NPATH's attempted path counting and recognition of McCabe's limitations  
3. **2000s**: Information-theoretic approaches and compression-based analysis
4. **2020s**: Violet's distributional complexity analysis combining information theory with cognitive insights

Violet represents a synthesis of these approaches, applying information-theoretic rigor to the practical problem of measuring code readability in a way that aligns with human cognitive patterns, and addresses a growing realization within the industry of code readability's very real impact on operational velocity and success.
