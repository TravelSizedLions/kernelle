If you had to give a heuristic confidence rating (0-100%), what would you say that is? Be pessimistic but honest. You're still picking up on a ton of context. The confidence rating is based on how you feel about implementing this feature or fixing this issue in *one shot* and then submitting an MR for review by a very picky reviewer who's worked on this code base for over a decade. If there's info you think you're missing, or if you feel like you can't know what you don't know yet, that should factor in. You should also report those confidence gaps.

It's also perfectly acceptable if the confidence rating goes down after repeat research and insights gathering. I'd rather this process be an honest reflection than anything else.
