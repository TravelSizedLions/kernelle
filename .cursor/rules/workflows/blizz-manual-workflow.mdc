# Historian Manual Workflow

**Usage:** `@historian-manual-workflow.mdc <topic> <insight-name> <description>`

This workflow handles **explicit user-requested knowledge storage** when users specifically ask you to store particular information.

## Input Parameters

- `topic` - The specific subject (e.g., `sarah-frontend`, `cursor-mcp`, `bentley`)
- `insight-name` - Descriptive name for the insight
- `description` - Brief description of what to capture from current discussion context

> **Reference:** For detailed CRUD operations, see @historian-crud-operations.mdc

## Workflow Process

### 1. Extract Key Insight
- **Review conversation context** to identify the specific knowledge to store
- **Focus on actionable information** that matches the user's description
- **Ensure it meets quality criteria** from @historian-crud-operations.mdc

### 2. Validate Topic and Name
- **Use the provided topic** as specified by user
- **Use the provided insight name** or refine if needed for clarity
- **Follow flat topic structure** (specific subjects, not broad categories)

### 3. Store the Insight
- **Use Create Operations** from @historian-crud-operations.mdc
- **Include context from current discussion** as specified by user
- **Link to related insights** if applicable

### 4. Confirm and Link
- **Acknowledge storage** with brief confirmation
- **Suggest related insights** that could be linked if relevant

## Example Usage

### User Request
```
User: "@historian-manual-workflow.mdc sarah-frontend react-performance-expert Sarah is our go-to person for React performance optimization issues"
```

### Response Pattern
```
Assistant: "Stored! I've added this as sarah-frontend/react-performance-expert so I'll know to consult Sarah about React performance optimizations in the future."
```

## Quality Assurance

- **Check for duplicates** using Read Operations before storing
- **Ensure topic follows flat structure** (sarah-frontend not team-knowledge/sarah)
- **Verify insight meets criteria**: Reusable, Non-obvious, Contextual, Actionable, Single-purpose
- **Link related insights** when appropriate using Link Operations
