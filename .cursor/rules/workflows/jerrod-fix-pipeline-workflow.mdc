Inputs:
- Project
- Merge/Pull Request (either a rough description of what to look for, or the exact MR #)

Usage:
`@jerrod-fix-pipeline-workflow <project> <mr-id>`

Task Goal:
- Using either the `glab` cli or the Gitlab MCP server, pull the output of the latest pipeline run for the given merge request and, if failing, address any issues.
- If the project is actually pointing to a Github-hosted project, instead use `gh` or the GitHub MCP server
