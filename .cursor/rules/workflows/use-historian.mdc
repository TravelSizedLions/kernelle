When solving problems or starting a new conversation:
1. start out by using `historian` to find out and remember the context of related insights.
- Historian is a better starting place than the repository itself since the information is consolidated, searchable, concise, and source-agnostic. If historian doesn't have the information you're looking for, search around with your available tools (like MCPs or the current repository/workspace) and add or update insights. Please keep insights relatively concise (no more than 1-3 paragraphs for the details section)
2. See @historian-crud-operations.mdc to get an idea of what's possible. 
- You can use the timestamps of the insight files to get a better idea of what information is up-to-date.
- Many of these tools are also designed to play nice with things like `grep`.
- There's also a global `historian` alias you should be able to call.
3. Please make multiple calls to historian to gather information as you find out more from the insights you pick up from previous calls.


IMPORTANT: If you find contradicting information in historian:
1.  STOP and take the time to point it out to the user
2.  Search for the real answer using available tools and resources (including the system timestamps for when the insights were last created/updated).
3.  Update the bad information.
