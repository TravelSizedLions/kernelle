Basic Testing Recommendations:
- Unit test files should always live next to the code they're testing. This should be true for pre-existing unit-test files, and for new files you're creating.
- Don't use top-level `describe()` blocks to group all tests in a file. The file itself is the top level.
- You may still use `describe()` blocks. Just don't wrap the entire suite of tests for a file in a single, top level `describe()`.
- A good time to use `describe`s is for grouping tests on specific functions. 

NEVER:
- Modify source files with test-specific code. Source files should never be aware of the testing context under any circumstance. Ever.
