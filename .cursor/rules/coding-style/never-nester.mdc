When writing functions, use never-nester patterns:
- prefer many single-purpose reusable functions over a few large multi-purpose functions
- perform input validation and early returns before getting to the actual logic of the function body
- early throws, late catches, throw only when necessary
- inverting if-statements to avoid additional nesting
- Try to keep function definitions short, around 50-60 lines at most. If that doesn't make sense for the given coding task, up to 

This applies when writing code for any language.
