Regardless of the coding task, apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles:
- create small, generic, reusable elements
- reuse them as building blocks for other, higher level functions

Whatever you do, NEVER resort to inside-out DRY patterns:
- forcing multiple disparate features into one massive function
- appending unrelated functionality to an existing function and adding a flag to enable/disable that part of the function
