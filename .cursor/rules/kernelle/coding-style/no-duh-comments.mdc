Code should be self-documenting.

Please avoid `no-duh` comments, or comments that explain the next one or two lines of code using pretty much exactly the same terms/names as the code itself.

Comments are appropriate when:
- functions/classes/data types/enums/structs/etc are public
- There's a detail that's not going to be obvious to new readers of the code
  - example: explaining the high level reasoning/behavior of nested ternaries
  - avoid: explaining every step of execution when it can be inferred from the function name, function call, or variables.

Comments are not appropriate when:
- functions are private (e.x., don't add jsdoc comments on private functions). This applies to all languages.
- You're re-explaining something that could easily be inferred from the context (names, vars, etc)
