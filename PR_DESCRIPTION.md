# Fix Blizz Neural Embedding Tokenizer Issues

This PR resolves critical issues preventing blizz neural embedding functionality from working, restoring full semantic search capabilities with proper BERT tokenization.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Embedded Tokenizer in Binary**
- **Problem**: The `tokenizer.json` file was corrupted, containing only vocabulary fragments instead of proper tokenizer structure
- **Solution**: Embedded complete tokenizer directly into binary using `include_bytes!()` macro
- **Files**: Added `crates/blizz/data/tokenizer.json` and updated `crates/blizz/src/embedding_model.rs`

### 2. **Added Missing ONNX Input Support**
- **Problem**: ONNX model expected `token_type_ids` input but blizz was only providing `input_ids` and `attention_mask`
- **Solution**: Enhanced `embedding_model.rs` to generate and provide all required BERT model inputs
- **Files**: Modified `crates/blizz/src/embedding_model.rs`

#### Technical Details:
- **Binary Embedding**: Used `include_bytes!("../data/tokenizer.json")` to embed 466KB tokenizer at compile time
- **Zero Dependencies**: Eliminated all file paths, downloads, and runtime tokenizer loading
- **Instant Loading**: Tokenizer loads directly from embedded data using `tokenizers::Tokenizer::from_bytes()`
- **Self-Contained**: Blizz binary now works immediately after installation with no setup
- Updated `batch_tokens()` function signature to return `(ids, mask, token_type_ids, batch, length)`
- Added token_type_ids generation (all zeros for sentence transformers)
- Updated ONNX inference call to include all three input tensors

## Issues Resolved

✅ **Fixed WordPiece Tokenization Errors**
- Eliminated `WordPiece error: Missing [UNK] token from the vocabulary`
- Restored proper handling of unknown tokens in embeddings

✅ **Fixed ONNX Model Input Errors** 
- Resolved `Missing Input: token_type_ids` runtime errors
- Ensured complete BERT model compatibility

✅ **Eliminated All External Dependencies**
- No more file path issues or missing tokenizer errors
- Zero-configuration installation and usage
- Completely self-contained binary distribution

✅ **Restored Neural Search Functionality**
- Neural embedding generation now works correctly
- Semantic similarity search operational
- All blizz search modes (exact, semantic, neural) functioning

## Testing
- [x] I have run `kernelle do checks` and all checks pass
- [x] Manual testing confirms blizz neural search works correctly
- [x] All search modes (--exact, --semantic, default neural) operational
- [x] No regression in existing exact/semantic search functionality
- [x] Embedded tokenizer loads instantly with zero external dependencies

## Checklist
- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation (via blizz insights)
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [x] Code follows Rust formatting standards (`kernelle do format`)
- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged and published

## Additional Notes

### Background
The blizz neural embedding system was completely non-functional due to two critical issues:
1. A corrupted tokenizer file that prevented proper text tokenization
2. Missing ONNX model inputs required for BERT-style transformers

### Revolutionary Approach
Instead of fixing file-based tokenizer loading, this PR takes a revolutionary approach by **embedding the tokenizer directly into the binary**. This eliminates an entire class of deployment and configuration issues.

### Impact
This fix restores blizz's most advanced search capabilities while making deployment bulletproof:
- High-quality semantic similarity matching via 384-dimensional embeddings
- Proper handling of complex queries and domain-specific terminology  
- Fast neural search that complements exact and semantic search modes
- **Zero-configuration deployment** - works immediately after `cargo install`
- **No external file dependencies** - completely self-contained binary

### Binary Size Impact
The tokenizer adds approximately 466KB to the binary size, which is acceptable for the massive reliability and usability improvements gained.

### Future Maintenance
- Tokenizer is permanently embedded and requires no external updates
- To update tokenizer: replace `crates/blizz/data/tokenizer.json` and rebuild
- Current implementation is production-ready and bulletproof
- Sets the gold standard for distributing ML model data with Rust binaries
